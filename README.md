FOOD-DELIVERY APP 
Welcome to the Food Delivery App! This project is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), providing a platform for users to purchase various Food products. Users can browse products, add them to their cart, review products, update their profile, and track order statuses.
